# Batch processing with Akka

The purpose of this project is the implementation of a batch processing using [Akka](http://akka.io). It's more a
proof of concept than a full productive solution, there is no special error handling.

The program reads a file with comma separated values (csv), the lines are converted to records and they are then
processed. The time needed is recorded. There also exists a non-parallel version to compare the processing speed.

*This are the basic requirements*

- the sequence of data in the output must be the same as in the input even if there is no sequential number in the
input data
- it must be possible to process files with an arbitrary number of records without memory or performance problems

*for this test the following processing is done*

 - creation of a record which contains the original csv value
 - creation a copy of the record
 - calculate a fibonacci number or do a thread sleep
 - when writing the output, the original csv value is used so that input and output can be compared using the diff
 command. This is to ensure that the records are written in the correct order.

# The used actors

The following sections describe the used actors and the messages that are passed between them. The program uses a
pull-pattern which ensures that the the work to be done is distributed among the actors which are not busy at the
moment. The idea for this I took from this [blog entry](http://www.michaelpollmeier.com/akka-work-pulling-pattern/)

## Reader

The ```Reader``` is the main actor of the whole program. The ```CSV2Record``` actors register with the ```Reader``` and
 the ```Reader``` gets the message to process a file. It reads the lines from the input file and takes care that there
 is always a limited number of records in the system. This prevents that the system is flooded with data and that the
 ```Writer``` has to buffer too many processed records if one records takes a little longer during processing.

### Incoming messages

- ```Register``` is sent by a ```CSV2Record``` to register with the Reader. This message must be resent regularly
because the ```Reader``` removes ```CSV2Record``` actors which don't self register after a certain time. This is to
prevent that the Reader sends data to actors which are no longer available.
- ```InitReader``` contains information about the file to process and is sent in the beginning by the Inbox of the system.
- ```GetWork``` is sent by a ```CSV2Record``` when this actor can process some data.
- ```RecordReceived```, contains the record id and is sent by the ```Writer``` if it has received the corresponding record.
The ```Reader``` then removes this record from the list of records that may have to be sent again.
- ```RecordsWritten``` is sent by the ```Writer``` when it has written some data to the output. The message contains
the number of written records and enables the ```Reader``` to read the next data.
- ```SendAgain``` is sent by the Reader itself. The purpose of this message is to check if some records need to be sent
again if the processing takes too long.

### Outgoing messages

- ```WorkAvailable``` is sent to all registered ```CSV2Record``` actors when new data is available.
- ```DoWork```, contains the record-id and the csv line, is sent to a ```CVS2Record``` actor in response to a
```GetWork``` message.
- ```WorkDone``` is sent to Inbox when all records are processed or there has been an error.

## Writer

The ```Writer``` is responsible to write the records it gets to the output file keeping the original order of the
records. To achieve this, the ```Writer``` has an internal buffer where the records are stored which can not yet be written
because they were processed faster than records which need to be written before them. The management of this records is
done by using the record id which is sequentially generated by the ```Reader```.

### Incoming messages

- ```InitWriter```, which contains name and encoding of the output file. Sent by the ```Inbox``` object.
- ```ProcessRecord```, which contains the record id, the processed record and the original csv line.

### Outgoing messages

- ```InitReady``` is sent to the Inbox when the InitWriter message was received and the internal structures are
initialized; contains a flag signaling success.
- ```RecordReceived```, contains a record-id and is sent to the ```Reader``` when a ```ProcessRecord``` message was
received to keep the Reader from sending the record again into the system.
- ```RecordsWritten``` is sent to the Reader when output records have been written. The message contains the number of
written records.

## CSV2Record
This actor converts a line in csv format into a record. For simulation purposes the actor just uses some processing
time as well.

### Incoming messages
- ```WorkAvailable```, is sent from the ```Reader``` to the registered ```CSV2Record``` actors, when there is data to
be processed.
- ```DoWork``` (contains the record id and the original line read), is sent from the ```Reader``` after the
```CSV2Record``` has sent a ```GetWork``` message to the Reader.

### Outgoing messages
- ```Register``` is sent regularly to the ```Reader```.
- ```GetWork```, is sent to the ```Reader``` when the actor is ready to do some work either after the previous work has
been processed or after the actor has received a ```WorkAvailable``` message.
- ```ProcessRecord``` (contains the record id, the original line and the processed record),
is sent to a RecordModifier.

## RecordModifier
This actor does the processing of the record.

### Incoming messages
- ```ProcessRecord``` (see ```CSV2Record```)

### Outgoing messages
- ```ProcessRecord``` (contains the processed record), is sent to the ```Writer```.

# Building and running the program

this is a maven project where the maven ```appassembler-maven-plugin``` plugin is configured to run during the package phase. So a simple
 *mvn package* command builds the whole stuff and creates a directory *target/AkkaBatch*. The bin subdirectory
 contains scripts for starting the program, the etc subdirectory contains the akkabatch.conf configuration file.
